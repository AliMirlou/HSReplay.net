# Let's talk about awfulware.
# There are so many layers at which this idiotic issue could have been prevented:
# - If Microsoft didn't make symlinks suck on windows
# - If Windows symlinks, sucky as they may be, were supported on Vagrant
# - If Vagrant didn't sell itself as the solution to "it works on my machine"
# - If those symlinks didn't exist in the first place
# - If npm properly supported prefixing (npm/npm#775)
# - If, more generally, npm wasn't one of the worst package managers ever created
# - If we stopped producing a new package manager for every single bloody language
# - If we as a community, and the JS community in particular, didn't let atrocious
#   engineering decisions plague extremely popular software. Awfulware should not
#   be allowed to become the norm.
# ... but I suppose, if that were the case, Windows wouldn't have been so popular
# in the first place and I wouldn't have to waste my time with this STUPID ISSUE.
